As we had already discussed in [another post](http://localhost:10003/web-hosting-types/), there are different types of web hosting. Out of those, dedicated server hosting is probably the most expensive and powerful one. It gives you access to a full physical machine with dedicated resources.

In a previous post, we had also discussed the different types of dedicated servers and the reasons to purchase one.

- See also: [What is Dedicated Hosting? Different Types & Use Cases](http://localhost:10003/what-is-dedicated-server-hosting/)

And in this post, you will find some of the best places to purchase dedicated hosting.

Also, note that most companies offer other types of hosting as well in addition to dedicated servers. So, there is no wonder if you find the same companies listed as the best provider for shared, cloud, or VPS hosting.

## 1. **Liquid Web**

[Liquid Web](http://localhost:10003/go/liquidweb-dedicated/) may not be as popular as Bluehost or Siteground. And there's a reason behind that.

They sell only high-end products like dedicated servers, VPS, and cloud hosting, which are mainly aimed at enterprise customers. You cannot find the regular shared hosting plans on Liquid Web.

So, it's not that well-known among bloggers and other small website owners. Liquid Web also owns another brand called Nexcess, which provides managed WordPress hosting.

Founded in 1997, the company is based in Michigan, the USA. They have three data centers - two in the USA and one in Europe. These are located at Michigan, Phoenix, and Amsterdam, all privately owned.

Liquid Web offers both managed and self-managed dedicated servers. The pricing starts at $199 per month for the 16GB server.

In addition to the traditional dedicated servers, they also offer cloud dedicated servers that use cloud technology instant provisioning capability. The pricing for that starts at $149 per month.

Great support is Liquid Web's main highlight, which is reinforced by the good ratings they have got on sites like [Trustpilot](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/liquidweb.com) - 4.6/5, as I am writing this post.

## 2. **Vultr Bare Metal**

Founded in 2014, [Vultr](http://localhost:10003/go/vultr/) came into the scene much later than the other companies mentioned in this post. The company is based in Florida, USA, and offers 22 server locations worldwide: 10 in North America, 7 in Europe,1 in South America, 3 in Asia, and the other is in Australia.

Being primarily a cloud provider, Vultr sells cheap cloud VPS instances starting at $5/month. Behind the scenes, it uses KVM virtualization technology. Their range of products includes cloud VPS, object storage, Kubernetes, and more.

In addition to all these, they also offer **bare metal servers**, which is what we are discussing here. Bare metal servers involve no virtualization and are single-tenant machines.

As of writing this post, the price for the bare metal instances starts at $120/month for a 32GB machine, which allows 5TB of bandwidth and 480GB SSD storage.

![Vultr bare metal servers](https://cdn-2.coralnodes.com/coralnodes/uploads/2022/02/vultr-bare-metal-plans-1-1080x564.png)

Bare metal servers are slightly different from traditional dedicated servers. The main advantage is that bare metal allows a pay-as-you-go pricing model. Vultr is also offering the same. Whereas with traditional dedicated servers, you usually need to lock in for monthly or yearly building cycles.

## **3. InMotion Hosting**

Founded in 2001, [InMotion Hosting](http://localhost:10003/go/inmotion-dedicated/) is another provider that offers dedicated servers in addition to other traditional hosting plans like shared hosting, VPS, reseller, and WordPress hosting.

Their data centers are located in the USA, in Los Angeles and Washington. If you are looking to host outside North America, then it may not be the right choice.

InMotion Hosting offers two categories of dedicated servers: **Unmanaged** and **Managed** the latter comes with cPanel as the control panel. And in each category, you can find three plans: **Essential**, **Advanced**, and **Elite**.

## 4. **A2 Hosting**

[A2 Hosting](http://localhost:10003/go/a2hosting-dedicated/) is another company known for offering performance-focused hosting products. Founded in 2003, the company is based out of Ann Arbor, Michigan.

Currently, they offer four server locations: two in the USA, one in Europe, and the other in Asia. These are respectively in Michigan, Arizona, Amsterdam, and Singapore.

Like InMotion Hosting, A2 Hosting also offers managed and unmanaged dedicated servers, each with four different plans.

Unmanaged dedicated plans:

- **Hyper 1, Hyper 2 AMD, Hyper 2 Turbo AMD, Hyper 2 Intel**

Similarly, there are four plans under managed dedicated hosting as well:

- **Warp 1, Warp 2 AMD, Warp 2 Turbo AMD, Warp 2 Intel**

![A2 Hosting dedicated server hosting plans](https://cdn-2.coralnodes.com/coralnodes/uploads/2022/02/a2-hosting-dedicated-1080x587.png)

Out of these plans, the cheapest one is the Hyper 1 Unmanaged plan that comes with 16GB of RAM, 2TB of SSD storage, and 6TB of bandwidth transfer. The price for the same is $199.99/month. While the highest is Hyper 2 Turbo AMD, which comes with 64GB of RAM and costs $379.99/month.

The two Turbo plans come with high memory capacity and M.2 NVMe SSD storage to ensure maximum performance.

## 5. **OVHcloud**

[OVHcloud](http://localhost:10003/go/ovhcloud-bare-metal/) is a European web hosting company founded in 1999 and based in Paris, France.

![](https://cdn-2.coralnodes.com/coralnodes/uploads/2022/02/ovh-cloud-dedicated-cloud-bare-metal-1080x599.png)

As a company that specializes in providing cloud and dedicated servers, OVHcloud stands out from the rest by offering over 40 different plans from 8 categories:

- **Enterprise**

Their services cover a wide range of use cases from machine learning to gaming.

## 6. **Bluehost**

[Bluehost](http://localhost:10003/go/bluehost-in-dedicated/) is probably the most popular name in the WordPress hosting industry. Known for their cheap shared hosting plans, Bluehost also offers managed WordPress hosting, hosting for WooCommerce, VPS, dedicated hosting, and website builder.

Currently, their services do not include any cloud offerings.

Founded in 2003, Bluehost is based in Utah, USA. The company is currently owned by Endurance International Group, which also owns other hosting companies like Hostgator and ResellerClub.

Bluehost is also one of the three hosting providers recommended by WordPress, the other two being Dreamhost and Siteground.

![Bluehost dedicated hosting](https://cdn-2.coralnodes.com/coralnodes/uploads/2022/02/bluehost-india-dedicated-1080x616.png)

Under the dedicated category, Bluehost offers 3 plans:

- **Standard:** $119.99/mo, 4GB memory, 5TB bandwidth
- **Enhanced:** $159.99/mo, 8GB memory, 10TB bandwidth
- **Premium:** $209.99/mo, 16GB memory, 15TB bandwidth

Unlike A2 Hosting and other providers I mentioned above, Bluehost does not offer any high-end dedicated servers. The maximum available memory is 16GB, which comes with the Premium plan.

But when I checked the Bluehost India website, the plans were a bit different. The Standard plan offered 8GB memory, Enhanced 16GB, and Premium 30GB memory.

Overall, the dedicated plans look like an upgrade for WordPress users who are coming from shared and VPS plans. It completely makes sense when considering that Bluehost is primarily known as a cheap hosting provider for WordPress users.

I couldn't get much information about the location of their data centers. However, Bluehost has regional websites in India, Australia, the UK, Canada, the USA, and many other countries.

## 7. **Dreamhost**

Founded in 1996, [Dreamhost](http://localhost:10003/go/dreamhost-dedicated/) is one of the oldest web hosting providers currently in operation.

The company is based out of California, the USA. It is also one of the three web hosts recommended by WordPress.

They offer some of the cheapest shared hosting plans out there. In addition to that, Dreamhost also offers a diverse array of other services including Managed WordPress Hosting (DreamPress), VPS, cloud, and dedicated hosting.

Recently, they have also entered the cloud computing field and are offering cheap cloud computing and object storage solutions. The cloud computing machines run on the OpenStack platform while the object storage systems use the Ceph platform.

When it comes to dedicated hosting, Dreamhost offers 9 plans as of now.

![Dreamhost fully managed dedicated server hosting](https://cdn-2.coralnodes.com/coralnodes/uploads/2022/02/dreamhost-dedicated-plans-1-1080x568.png)

Starting at the **Standard** plan that offers 4GB of memory, 1TB of HDD storage, and  4-core 8-threaded CPU, the range goes all the way up to the **Enhanced SSD** plan, which offers 64GB of RAM 12-core 24-threaded CPU, and 240GB SSD storage.

Dreamhost offers two server locations - one is in Ashburn, Virginia and the other is in Hillsboro, Oregon.

So if you are looking for server locations outside the USA, such as in Europe or Asia, then Dreamhost may not be the right choice. But otherwise, it offers attractive pricing and a nice set of features.
