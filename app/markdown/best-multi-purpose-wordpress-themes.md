Multi-purpose themes are the go-to solutions when you need lots of features and customizability while creating a website.

On the other hand, niche themes offer simplicity at the cost of customizability. So, which one is better? The answer depends on your needs.

For example, if you are a web designer who creates many websites for clients, then learning to use a mega theme may be a better investment of time. They offer more freedom in design than a pre-built theme.

However, choosing such a theme has become a difficult job due to the sheer amount of options available. That's why I have curated the list below.

The list is not just a reflection of my favorites. Instead, I have spent some time to do trend analysis and keyword research to find what is currently popular among WordPress users.

## List of Best WordPress Multi-purpose Themes

### 1. Avada

![](https://cdn-2.coralnodes.com/coralnodes/uploads/2019/09/mt-avada-1-1080x601.jpg)

With over 525k+ sales, Avada is currently the top-selling theme on Themeforest.

ThemeFusion has done a great job by offering tons of features, which allow you to create almost any type of website you can imagine. With around fifty demo sites to import, Avada is highly versatile.

The theme gives fifty options panel in the Customizer alone. Along with that, you can use **Fusion Builder** to create pages visually.

Creator: **ThemeFusion**  
Sold on: **ThemeForest**  
Price: **$60**

### 2. Astra

![](https://cdn-2.coralnodes.com/coralnodes/uploads/2019/09/mt-astra-1-1080x708.jpg)

Astra takes a different approach when compared to Avada. Instead of packing all the features into the theme, it offers a lightweight base theme along with a handful of starter sites, which are compatible with modern page builders like Elementor and Brizy.

- [Know more about WP Astra](http://localhost:10003/astra-theme-review/)

If you prefer performance, then Astra's base theme is a great option. It's fully functional while keeping the size under 50KB. Otherwise, you can import a suitable starter site along with the necessary plugins.

In short, Astra offers the best of both worlds between heavyweight multi-purpose themes and niche websites.

Unlike Themeforest themes, Astra allows you to use the license on unlimited sites. There are three plans, and you can choose between a yearly or lifetime billing schedule.

![](https://cdn-2.coralnodes.com/coralnodes/uploads/2019/09/mt-divi-1-1080x610.jpg)

Divi is the flagship all-in-one theme from **Elegant Themes** that includes a powerful page builder.

With an Elegant Themes membership, you get access to the Divi theme along with their premium plugins like **Monarch**‚ and **Bloom**.

The theme is also equipped with several handy design elements like galleries, forms, effects, and filters. In addition to these, the split-testing feature enables you to try different design combinations on your site.

If you want only the page builder functionality, you can get it as a standalone plugin as well, instead of installing the whole theme.

The **Divi Builder plugin** also allows you to use any other theme, not just Divi's. Since Divi depends on shortcodes, your pages will be left with ugly shortcodes if you disable the theme. With the plugin enabled, this problem won't occur.

## Conclusion

As you might have noticed, although all themes have a lot in common, each of them differs from the others by providing a unique feature or advantage.

Also, you can see that independent theme shops like Astra, GeneratePress, and ThemeIsle take a different approach by providing a lightweight base theme.

So, choosing a theme should be based on your requirements. I hope that the above list will serve as a base for your selection.
